# Git Task Steps

1. The following is a link that takes you to one of our testing repositories: https://github.com/JoinCODED/pre-course-git
2. Fork that repository.
3. Clone it in your `Development`: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/pre-course-git`
4. Use the command `cd` to move into the repository folder: `cd pre-course-git`
5. Use the command `touch` to create an example file: `touch example.js`
6. Add all the files to the repository: `git add .`
7. Commit all the files: `git commit -m "solved git task!"`
8. Push to the remote repository: `git push`
9. Open the repository page on GitHub, you should now see two files: `example.txt` and `example.js`

That's it! Well done!! Please share a link to your repository with the instructor.

# Known Potential Issues

If this is your first time using git, you might see the following message:

```bash
*** Please tell me who you are.
```

Here's how to fix it:

1. Run the command `git config --global user.email ""` with your github email address in the quotation marks.
2. Run the command `git config --global user.name ""` with your github username in the quotation marks.

Then do the last step you were doing in the task.

Then you might be asked to login to your github account. When you enter your password, it won't display anything on the screen, just keep typing and hit Enter.
