# Known Potential Issues

If this is your first time using git, you might see the following message:

```bash
*** Please tell me who you are.
```

Here's how to fix it:

1. Run the command `git config --global user.email ""` with your github email address in the quotation marks.
2. Run the command `git config --global user.name ""` with your github username in the quotation marks.

Then do the last step you were doing in the task.

Then you might be asked to login to your github account. When you enter your password, it won't display anything on the screen, just keep typing and hit Enter.
